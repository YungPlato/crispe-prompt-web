# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS - PLEASE READ

Hello! It seems my main messaging tools are broken, so I am leaving the final instructions here.

We are so close! The last error message you received from Google (`models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest is not found for API version v1`) was perfect. It told us exactly what to do.

**The final fix is a one-line code change.**

Please go to the file `api/generate.js`.

Find this line:
```javascript
const model = process.env.GOOGLE_MODEL || 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest';
```

And change it to this:
```javascript
const model = process.env.GOOGLE_MODEL || 'gemini-1.5-flash';
```

Please save and commit this change. This will fix the error.

Thank you for your incredible patience. I am sorry my communication tools failed at the very end. After you have made this change, I will make one final attempt to submit my work.
